# Getting started

An **Optimization** game is very similar to a **Solo** game. This is why we adapted the example game "Fishy Adventures" to make it an optimization game.

It is suggested to follow the [Solo game creation guide](tutorial-3-solo.md) with the adapted version. The source code is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/CodinGame/game-fishy-adventures/tree/optimization](https://github.com/CodinGame/game-fishy-adventures/tree/optimization)

## Import project

As stated in the Solo guide, you need to download the source code of the game. The Optimization version of the game is located on the `optimization` branch of the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/CodinGame/game-fishy-adventures.git
git checkout optimization
```

Then, import this project as an existing maven project into your IDE:
- Eclipse: File > Import > Existing Maven Projects
- IntelliJ IDEA: Import Project > Select game-tictactoe > Import project from external model > Maven
