# Getting started

An **Optimization** game is very similar to a **Solo** game. This is why we adapted the example game "Fishy Adventures" to make it an optimization game.

It is suggested to follow the [Solo game creation guide](tutorial-3-solo.md) with the adapted version. The source code is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/CodinGame/game-fishy-adventures/tree/optimization](https://github.com/CodinGame/game-fishy-adventures/tree/optimization)
