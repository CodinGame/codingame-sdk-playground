# EndScreenModule

Requires game engine version 1.35 or higher.

Can be used to display the ranking of a multiplayer game with any additional info you choose. The ranking will appear at the very end of the replay.

This module requires an image named `title_ranking.png` (see how to load assets [here](core-concepts/core-4-configuration.md#loading-assets)). You can either add your own image or remove the line in `TooltipModule.js` which displays this image.

To guarantee the correct ranking, you must set this module's score property in your Referee's `onEnd()` method.

### Example
`Referee.java`
```java
  @Override
  public void onEnd() {
      endScreenModule.setScores(gameManager.getPlayers().stream().mapToInt(p -> p.getScore()).toArray());
  }
```

âš  This example might require you modify it for proper use in your own game.
