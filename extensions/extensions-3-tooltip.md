# TooltipModule

This module can be used to assign some data to an entity from the [GraphicEntityModule](https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/tree/master/engine/modules/entities). The data will be displayed in a tooltip when the mouse cursor hovers over the entity on screen.

You may change the assigned data of each entity once per game turn.

The majority of the text to display should be written into your copy of the tooltip module to reduce the amount of data the Referee must produce.
